			About this site

		<p>
			This site was made in HTML and CSS and some JavaScript. For rendering LaTeX I used JavaScript library called

			More about me
		</h1>
		<p>
			Some of my interests lie in tech-related topics such as home labbing, POSIX systems like Linux and UNIX, and
			programming in languages including C++, Java, Lua, Bash, and Intel x86 Assembly. My home lab runs on
			<a class="inline-link" style="color: #bf616a;" href="https://www.freebsd.org/" target="_blank">FreeBSD</a>
			and uses Jails to separate services such as Plex, Nginx, and a dedicated development environment.

			What am I up to recently

			<p>
				Building a 16 bit RISC CPU:
			</p>
			<p>
				I have recently taken and completed CSCI 343 Computer Architecture and have learned the workings of the MIPS CPU,
				including pipelining, pathways, and assembly code.
				While taking this course I have taken what I was learning in class and applied it to my own project of building a 16 bit CPU.
				You can find my project linked here:

				Learning Rust:
			</p>
			<p>
				I have build my first graphical application in the Rust programming language.
				It is a simple calculator program that uses GTK for its graphical library.
				Here is the link to the <a class="inline-link" style="color: #88c0d0"
					href="https://github.com/AdarshPatel0/Rust-Calculator" target="_blank">project repository</a> on
				Github.

				Custom Email:
			</p>
			<p>
				Using my own subdomain, I set up a public inbox with Zoho as the provider. I spent a day learning how to
				configure DNS records—not just to get it working, but also to ensure that my emails are sent securely
				and aren't automatically flagged as spam by other providers.

				Rebuilding this website:
			</p>
			<p>
				I originally created this website in July 2024, but as of June 2025, I've decided to rebuild it from
				scratch. The main reason is that the original version was also my first attempt at building a website.
				Needless to say, it turned out a bit ugly—though it did have a certain early-2000s charm. This time
				around, my goal is to prioritize readability while also giving the site a cleaner, more modern look.

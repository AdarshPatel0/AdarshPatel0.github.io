			What am I up to recently

			<p>
				Custom Email:
			</p>
			<p>
				Using my own subdomain I set up a public inbox using Zoho as a provider.
				I spent a day learning how to set up DNS records so that I can not only make this work, but also have my
				mail be sent securely and have so that other email providers don't automatically flag my address

				Rebuilding this website:
			</p>
			<p>
				I created this website back in July 2024 but as of June 2025, I have decided to rebuild it from scratch.
				This was primarily due to the first time I built this website was also the first time I actually built a
				website.
				Needless to say, it was kind of ugly, though it did have the style of a website from the early 2000's.
				Now I have made it my aim for this website to prioritize readability while also looking somewhat nice.

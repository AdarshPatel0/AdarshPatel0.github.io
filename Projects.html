                This is my first project written in Rust.
                It is a simple graphical calculator that uses GTK as it's graphics library.
                This project taught me alot about rust, with me learning new comcepts such as borrowing.
                The biggest challenge I had was when I was trying to figure out how to bind GTK's graphical event signals to other parts of my code.
                I used concepts I learned in my Java course, such as Model, View, Controller.

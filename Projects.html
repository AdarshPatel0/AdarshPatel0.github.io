                This is my first project written in Rust.
                It is a simple graphical calculator that uses GTK as it's graphics library.
                This project taught me alot about rust, with me learning new comcepts such as borrowing.
                The biggest challenge I had was when I was trying to figure out how to bind GTK's graphical event
                signals to other parts of my code.
                I used concepts I learned in my Java course, such as Model, View, Controller.

                This is my first backend rust project.
                It uses libraries native to rust like TcpListener and TcpStream.
                It supports basic html & css pages and can load other file formats for photos and documents.
                It includes a 404 page not found handler aswell.

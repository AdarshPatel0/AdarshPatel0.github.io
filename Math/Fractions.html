        <h1>Fractions</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h3>What are fractions?</h3>
        <p>Fractions are a way of representing numbers in a rational form.
            Every rational number can be represented as a pair of integers in a fraction. Here are some examples:</p>

        <p>\[\frac{1}{2}\text{ One Half}\]</p>
        <p>\[\frac{3}{4}\text{ Three Quarters}\]</p>
        <p>\[\frac{4}{3}\text{ Four Thirds}\]</p>

        <h3>Why Fractions?</h3>
        <p>Imagine you have a pizza that is \(1ft^2\), and we split it into 3 slices.
            What is the exact size of an individual slice?</p>

        <p>Using the formula \(\frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Parts}}\):</p>

        <p>\[\frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33333333 = \textit{Slice Area}\]</p>

        <p>Now let’s find how much pizza we have if we have 3 slices of the same size using the formula \(\textit{Slice
            Area} \cdot \text{Parts}\):</p>

        <p>\[0.33333333 \cdot 3 = 0.9999999\]</p>

        <p>Hold on, it seems like a small slice of our pizza has gone missing!
            If we split our \(1ft^2\) pizza into 3 slices, and then reassembled it back together,
            we should end up with a pizza that is still \(1ft^2\), right?</p>

        <p>The issue lies in our first calculation where we used an approximation (\(\approx\)) to find the area of a
            slice,
            meaning that we found an answer that is very close but not exact.</p>

        <p>How about we instead kept the size of a slice as a fraction and wrote it as \(\frac{1}{3}\), and then apply
            it to our second formula?</p>

        <p>\[\frac{1}{3} \cdot 3 = 1\]</p>

        <p>We see that now we have the original area of our pizza when we combine the area of all three slices
            represented as a fraction.
            Not only is the answer correct, but we can also guarantee it to be accurate since it does not use any
            approximation.</p>

        <h2>Manipulating Fractions</h2>

        <h3>Simplifying fractions</h3>
        <p>Sometimes it's easier to work with smaller numbers, which is why we simplify fractions
            so that their numerator and denominator are the smallest they can get.</p>

        <p>Take this fraction as an example: \(\frac{24}{40}\). This fraction can be hard to work and visualize with.
            By simplifying this fraction, we can rewrite it as \(\frac{3}{5}\).</p>

        <p>To do this we must find a number that both the numerator and denominator can be divided by. Let’s try 2:</p>
        <p>\[\frac{24 \div 2}{40 \div 2} = \frac{12}{20}\]</p>

        <p>Note that both of these fractions are the same, we are just rewriting them.</p>

        <p>We can continue dividing both the numerator and denominator by some number:</p>
        <p>\[\frac{12 \div 4}{20 \div 4} = \frac{3}{5}\]</p>

        <p>Our fraction rewritten now as \(\frac{3}{5}\) is the same as \(\frac{24}{40}\):</p>
        <p>\[\frac{24}{40} = \frac{3}{5}\]</p>

        <h3>Rewriting fractions</h3>
        <p>Every number can be written as itself over 1:</p>
        <p>\[a = \frac{a}{1}\]</p>

        <p>A number over itself will always equal 1:</p>
        <p>\[\frac{a}{a} = 1\]</p>

        <p>A fraction’s numerator and denominator can be split up:</p>
        <p>\[\frac{a}{b} = \frac{a}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{b} = a \cdot \frac{1}{b}\]</p>

        <p>And be split up further by splitting up its factors:</p>
        <p>\[\frac{ab}{cd} = a \cdot b \cdot \frac{1}{c} \cdot \frac{1}{d}\]</p>
        <p>\[\frac{ab}{c} = \frac{a}{c} \cdot \frac{b}{c}\]</p>

        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> These rules of rewriting fractions only apply to multiplication and division ONLY!</p>

        <p>\[\frac{a + b}{c} \ne \frac{a}{c} + \frac{b}{c}\]</p>

        <p>But, you <em>can</em> do this:</p>
        <p>\[\frac{a + b}{c} = \frac{1}{c} \cdot (a + b)\]</p>

        <h3>Multiplying fractions</h3>
        <p>Multiplying two fractions is done by multiplying the numerators and denominators:</p>
        <p>\[\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d} = \frac{ac}{bd}\]</p>

        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>\[\frac{3}{7} \cdot \frac{5}{2} = \frac{3 \cdot 5}{7 \cdot 2} = \frac{15}{14}\]</p>

        <h3>Dividing fractions</h3>
        <p>Dividing fractions can be done through the <strong>Keep-Change-Flip</strong> method:</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Keep the first fraction</strong></p>
        <p>\[\frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d}\]</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Change the sign to multiplication</strong></p>
        <p>\[\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d}\]</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Flip the second fraction</strong></p>
        <p>\[\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{d}{c}\]</p>

        <p><strong>And now we only need to multiply like before:</strong></p>
        <p>\[\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{d}{c} = \frac{ad}{bc}\]</p>

        <p>Here is an example:</p>

        <p><strong>Keep</strong></p>
        <p>\[\frac{3}{7} \div \frac{2}{5}\]</p>

        <p><strong>Change</strong></p>
        <p>\[\frac{3}{7} \cdot \frac{2}{5}\]</p>

        <p><strong>Flip</strong></p>
        <p>\[\frac{3}{7} \cdot \frac{5}{2}\]</p>

        <p><strong>Now multiply</strong></p>
        <p>\[\frac{3}{7} \cdot \frac{5}{2} = \frac{15}{14}\]</p>
